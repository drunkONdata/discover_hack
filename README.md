2018 Hack Your Trip Hackathon - Seattle, WA

### The Challenge
Hack the travel industry by using two to three of Discover’s APIs to create an innovative solution with the goal of improving the travel experience.

### Motivation
Over 50% of U.S. vacationers admit they're more stressed today compared to a year ago, and it's causing more than one in three (37%) to cancel or delay their trip, according to a survey by Wyndham Vacation Rentals (2017). How can we mitigate this stress?
